SUGARCLOUD:

Small app to track your sugar levels and insulin.

DEPENDENCIES:

This app is based on CodeIgniter. For the users module, it uses ION_AUTH by Ben Edmunds.
For the debuggin, Kint by Adriangonzales is the library used (adapted for CodeIgniter).

To show the graphics, It uses the javascript libraries Morris-Chart and Raphael. Also, the app needs Bootstrap as well as JQuery.

Probably another lib has been integrated, if I forgot any, I apologize to the author.
